   abstract = {Chromosomal rearrangements (e.g., fusions/fissions) have the potential to drive speciation. However, their accumulation in a population is generally viewed as unlikely, because chromosomal heterozygosity should lead to meiotic problems and aneuploid gametes. Canonical meiosis involves segregation of homologous chromosomes in meiosis I and sister chromatid segregation during meiosis II. In organisms with holocentric chromosomes, which are characterized by kinetic activity distributed along almost the entire chromosome length, this order may be inverted depending on their metaphase I orientation. Here we analyzed the evolutionary role of this intrinsic versatility of holocentric chromosomes, which is not available to monocentric ones, by studying F1 to F4 hybrids between two chromosomal races of the Wood White butterfly (Leptidea sinapis), separated by at least 24 chromosomal fusions/fissions. We found that these chromosomal rearrangements resulted in multiple meiotic multivalents, and, contrary to the theoretical prediction, the hybrids displayed relatively high reproductive fitness (42% of that of the control lines) and regular behavior of meiotic chromosomes. In the hybrids, we also discovered inverted meiosis, in which the first and critical stage of chromosome number reduction was replaced by the less risky stage of sister chromatid separation. We hypothesize that the ability to invert the order of the main meiotic events facilitates proper chromosome segregation and hence rescues fertility and viability in chromosomal hybrids, potentially promoting dynamic karyotype evolution and chromosomal speciation.},

@article{Linge2021,
   abstract = {This article considers the sexual politics of animal evidence in the context of German sexology around 1920. In the 1910s, the German-Jewish geneticist Richard B. Goldschmidt conducted experiments on the moth Lymantria dispar, and discovered individuals that were no longer clearly identifiable as male or female. When he published an article tentatively arguing that his research on ‘intersex butterflies’ could be used to inform concurrent debates about human homosexuality, he triggered a flurry of responses from Berlin-based sexologists. In this article, I examine how a number of well-known sexologists affiliated with Magnus Hirschfeld, his Scientific-Humanitarian Committee, and later his Institute of Sexology attempted to incorporate Goldschmidt’s experiments into their sexological work between 1917 and 1923. Intersex butterflies were used to discuss issues at the heart of German sexology: the legal debate about the criminalisation of homosexuality under paragraph 175; the scientific methodology of sexology, caught between psychiatric, biological, and sociological approaches to the study of sexual and gender diversity; and the status of sexology as natural science, able to contribute knowledge about the sexual Konstitution of the organism. This article thus shows that butterfly experiments function as important and politically charged evidence for a discussion at the heart of the sexological project of those involved in the founding of the Institute of Sexology: the question of the nature and naturalness of homosexuality (and sexual intermediacy more broadly) and its political consequences. In doing so, this article makes a case for paying attention to non-human actors in the history of sexology.},

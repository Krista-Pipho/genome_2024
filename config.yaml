sample: "SRR13577847" # Sample name, used for naming input and output files
compare_assembly: "S288C_ref" # Assembly to compare against for dotplots
cores: 30 # Number of cores, where required to specify 

### Optional operations to perform

filter_reads: False # Whether to filter reads with kraken2 before assembly
run_genomescope: True # Whether to run genomescope2
assemble_mito: False # Whether to run oatk to assemble the mitochondrial genome
generate_data_for_dotplot: True # Whether to generate data for dotplots comparing assembly to a reference genome. View dotplots at https://dot.sandbox.bio/
find_telomeres: False # Whether to run tidk to find telomeric repeats
repeat_masking: False # Whether to run repeatmasker to generate a masked refference genome
# If you would like to provide a repeat library for masking place the file at sample_consensi.fa in the main directory. 
# If no file is provided one will be generated from your genome using RepeatModeler. This process takes a very long time to run. 

### Parameters for optional operations

# Download a mid-sized (16gb) standard kraken2 database, find this and others at https://benlangmead.github.io/aws-indexes/k2
# For errors, check that the download location hard coded in kraken_snakemake.smk line # is still correct 
kraken_database: "k2_standard_16_GB_20250714" # Name of the kraken2 database file
busco_lineage: "saccharomycetes" # Find here https://busco.ezlab.org/list_of_lineages.html
tidk_lineage: "NA" # Find here https://github.com/tolkit/a-telomeric-repeat-database
oatk_db: "OatkDB/v20230921/dikarya_mito.fam" # Find here https://github.com/c-zhou/OatkDB/tree/main/v20230921

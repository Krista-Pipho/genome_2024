   abstract = {Heliconius butterflies (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) are a group of 48 neotropical species widely studied in evolutionary research. Despite the wealth of genomic data generated in past years, chromosomal level genome assemblies currently exist for only two species,Heliconiusmelpomene andHeliconius erato, each a representative of one of the twomajor clades of thegenus.Here,we use these referencegenomes toimprove the contiguity of previouslypublisheddraft genomeassembliesof16Heliconius species.Using a reference-assisted scaffolding approach,we place and order the scaffolds of these genomes onto chromosomes, resulting in 95.7 99.9%of their genomes anchored to chromosomes.Genome sizes are somewhat variable among species (270 422Mb) and in one smallgroupof species (Heliconius hecale,Heliconius elevatus, andHeliconius pardalinus) expansions in genomesize are drivenmainly by repetitive sequences that map to four small regions in the H. melpomene reference genome. Genes from these repeat regions show an increase in exon copynumber, an absence of internal stop codons, evidence of constraint on nonsynonymous changes, and increased expression, all of which suggest that at least some of the extra copies are functional. Finally, we conducted a systematic search for inversions and identified fivemoderately large inversions fixed between the twomajorHeliconius clades.We infer that one of these inversions was transferred by introgression between the lineages leading to the erato/sara and burneyi/doris clades. These reference-guided assemblies represent a major improvement in Heliconius genomic resources that enable further genetic and evolutionary discoveries in this genus.},

   abstract = {Cytogenetics and gene flow were studied in microbe-associated parthenogenetic (thelytokous) forms of three species of the genus Trichogramma (T pretiosum, T deion and T. nr. deion). The chromosome behaviour in newly laid eggs indicated that the mechanism allowing restoration of diploidy in unfertilized thelytokous eggs was a segregation failure of the two sets of chromosomes in the first mitotic anaphase. This results in a nucleus containing two sets of identical chromosomes. The mechanism is known as gamete duplication and results m complete homozygosity. This was confirmed by investigation of the segregation pattern of allozymes in the offspring of heterozygous thelytokous females. Contrary to the generally assumed genetic isolation of thelytokous lines, thelytokous females of these species can mate and will use the sperm to fertilize some of their eggs. These fertilized eggs give rise to females whose genome consists of one set of chromosomes from each parent. Egg fertilization and the resulting syngamy of the sperm and egg pronucleus apparently precludes the gamete duplication that would have taken place if the egg had remained unfertilized. Most field populations of Trichogramma contain both parthenogenetic (thelytokous) and sexual (arrhenotokous) forms. In the two field populations that we studied there was evidence for high levels of gene flow from the sexual (arrhenotokous) fraction to the parthenogenetic (thelytokous) fraction of the population. The implications of the cytogenetic mechanism of parthenogenesis, i.e. gamete duplication, for the mechanism of sex determination in Hymenoptera are discussed.},

Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in rule assembly in file /work/alh166/genome_2024/src/Snakefile, line 9:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
../analysis/bc2011.p_ctg.fa (missing locally, parent dir contents: .histo, genomeFasta.fa, bc2010.histo)
../logs/bc2011.log (missing locally, parent dir contents: bc2009.asm.log, logFiles.txt, bc2011.log#intput)
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message

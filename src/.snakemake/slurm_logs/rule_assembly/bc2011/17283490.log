Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in rule assembly in file /work/alh166/genome_2024/src/Snakefile, line 10:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
../analysis/snake/bc2011.bp.p_ctg.gfa (missing locally, parent dir contents: )
Removing output files of failed job assembly since they might be corrupted:
../logs/bc2011.log
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message

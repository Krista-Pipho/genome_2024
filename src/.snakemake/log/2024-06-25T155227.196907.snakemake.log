MissingOutputException in rule assembly2 in file /work/alh166/genome_2024/src/Snakefile, line 19:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
../results/m84165_231212_214911_s4.hifi_reads.bc2011.bam.fa.bp.p_utg.gfa (missing locally, parent dir contents: transformed_log_plot.png, summary.txt, progress.txt, log_plot.png, linear_plot.png, model.txt, transformed_linear_plot.png, maskedGenome.fa)
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message

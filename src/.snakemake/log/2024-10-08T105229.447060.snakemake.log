No wall time information given. This might or might not work on your cluster. If not, specify the resource runtime in your rule or as a reasonable default via --default-resources.
No job memory information ('mem_mb' or 'mem_mb_per_cpu') is given - submitting without. This might or might not work on your cluster.
